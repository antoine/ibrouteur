          <li>iBrouteur let you browse a collection of file depicting the life of me, maybe other persons will be presented but you should ignore them as much as possible</li>
          <li>Each file of this collection is associated with tags, some of the tags belong to specific categories the others are just labels</li>
          <li>In order to browse the files you have to select at least one value in one index (like you want all the files created in the month of september, here the index is month and the value september - this will give you all the files of september for EVERY year though ;)</li>
          <li>You can use more than one index to refine your selection, the system will do everything it can in order to ensure that your selection will never be empty (no, you won't be able to select the file created during the 3rd week of the year AND the month of December...)</li>
          <li>In case you don't like it you can start playing around with the url, this is simple enough that you should be able to look for those files created during the 3rd week and the month of December, moron. Please refer to the <a href="url.html">url diy guidelines</a></li>
          <li>When viewing a file a new section named naviguation appear, it let you jump to the files close to the current one in the list of images you are currently viewing</li>
